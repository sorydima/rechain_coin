# REChain ®️ 🪐

Implementation of a <https://matrix.katya.wtf> node in Python based on the Katya ® 👽 Kit framework.

> **NOTE:** In 2019, we split our implementation of "REChain ®️ 🪐 Coin" from its development framework
> "Katya ® 👽 Kit".

This repo contains runtimes for the REChain ®️ 🪐 Coin network based on C++ & QT Technology. The README file provides
information about installing the `REChain ®️ 🪐 Coin` binary and developing on the codebase.

Intro
-----
RecCoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic token system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run reccoin-qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:
  sudo apt-get install libqtgui4

Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/reccoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
 bin/32/reccoin (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/reccoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
 bin/64/reccoin (headless, 64-bit)
